# UNIBA_ELM_Fotografiamo
The aim of the project is to design and then create an e-learning platform, defining its environment and didactic aspects.  

The cultural non-profit association "Fotografiamo" offers courses, educational meetings, workshops, exhibitions, seminars, photographic competitions, photographic meetings and all that is needed to encourage photographic culture.   

Due to the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the association asks the LMT group for an e-learning platform to support its digital photography courses and to establish its online presence.
