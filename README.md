# UNIBA_ELM_Fotografiamo
The aim of the project is to design and then create an e-learning platform, defining its environment and didactic aspects.  The cultural photography association "Fotografiamo" is a non-profit association that offers courses, educational meetings, workshops, exhibitions, seminars, photographic competitions, photographic meetings and all that is needed to encourage culture photographic.   Following the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the association asks the LMT group for an e-learning platform to support its digital photography courses and to establish its online presence.
